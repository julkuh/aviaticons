# aviaticons

Aviaticons is going to be a webfont dedicated to all aviation-lovers and those who develop applications or websites for those who love aviation.

**In Short:** A webfont suite containing aviation related, vector based, easy to use icons. 

## Contributing
Contribution is very welcome. The more icons we have, the more usefull the webfont will be ;)
General rules for pull requests:
* the Icons should be in the visual style of the exisiting ones (mostly flat and solid, not oultined)
* the icons should depict objects from aviation (this includes aircrafts, airport buildings, weather and aviation-map symbology)
* make your pull-request just in `.src/svg/`
Many thanks for contributing.
